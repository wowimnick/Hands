# Hands
Hand mapping and gesture detection

Using the MediaPipe library, I have created a module on which i can create other projects (module.py). This module is able to detect and draw landmarks and connections on your hands. 
Count.py, using the module that was created earlier, can see and count every finger raised on your hand. Pinchcontrol.py, also using the module that was created earlier, can control the volume on your device using the distance between your index and thumb tips.
